# Java-Toy-Language-Interpreter

This is an application that executes a set of statements as IF, FOR, WHILE, FORK etc. and evaluates expressions.
The statements and expressions are hardcoded in the app. The user can select a program from a list and run it viewing, step by step, how its executed.
All of this are presented as a GUI application. I used Java and JavaFX.
